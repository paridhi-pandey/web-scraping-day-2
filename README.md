# web-scraping-day-2
Explored how to scrape data from websites that load content dynamically using browser automation tools. 
Practiced interacting with elements on a webpage just like a user would—such as clicking buttons or entering text—to extract information. Applied this to collect data from a dynamic site and also tried replicating the task using a more traditional scraping method for comparison.
